	Bogdan:
		1)	DONE Calendar – see attached – the Month and the days of the week, would be best to be described in words (August or Aug and Mon or M)
		2)	(no api found yet) Calendar – If possible – if you can color code the weekends in a different shade or color I think it would improve the efficiency
		3)	- V2 Once you figure out how to modify the form dynamically, I believe all 4 type of request links can be merged into one, and based on the Type of the request… to modify the input fields. It will create less confusion.
		4)	DONE The approved email has no formatting
